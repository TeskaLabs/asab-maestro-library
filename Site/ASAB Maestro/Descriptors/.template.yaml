  name: Hello world  # You can name the descriptor as you need. Just keep in mind the file name of the descriptor must be the same as service name used in the model.

  volumes:
  - "{{SITE}}/{{INSTANCE_ID}}/conf:/conf"
  # Here you can type anything that is allowed in docker-compose.yaml within the service specification.

# Sherpas containers: akin to their namesake mountain guides, these containers provide essential support and guidance throughout the application's lifecycle.
# provide a name to your sherpa and a descriptor parts overwriting the main descriptor
  init:
    command: ["echo", "DONE"]  # i.e.

files:
# File paths are gonna be applied to /Site/<app_name>/Files/<your file as you declare it>
# Being used in the docker-compose file as a volume, the /Site/<app_name>/Files/ part of path is substituted by {{SITE}}/{{INSTANCE_ID}}/
# There are three ways of declaring files used as container volumes
# - directly in this yaml declaration - keep it as key:value pait where value is the file content
# - using a whole directory in /Site/<app_name>/Files - keep trailing slash in this case
# - use specific file from /Site/<app_name>/Files directory
# Please keep in mind you work in 3 stages:
# - you specify the file here
# - it becomes part of a site directory
# - it get mounted into a container
