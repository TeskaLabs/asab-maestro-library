files:
# File paths are gonna be applied to /Site/<app_name>/Files/<your file as you declare it>
# Being used in the docker-compose file as a volume, the /Site/<app_name>/Files/ part of path is substituted by {{SITE}}/{{INSTANCE_ID}}/
# There are three ways of declaring files used as container volumes
# - directly in this yaml declaration - keep it as key:value pait where value is the file content
# - using a whole directory as /Site/<app_name>/Files/<service_id>/some_directory/ - keep trailing slash in this case
# - use specific file as /Site/<app_name>/Files/<service_id>/some_file.json
# Please keep in mind you work in 3 stages:
# - you specify the file here
# - it becomes part of a site directory
# - it get mounted into a container
